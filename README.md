# UNO-Online
This is a multiplayer UNO game (8 servers, each server can host maximum of 4 players)
We used NodeJS, and websockets to connect everything to their respective servers

Took us about 2-weeks to make, after-school and during-school hours.
We weren't fully aware of coding and commenting conventions, which is why comments and code formatting may be extremely inconsistent in many sections

This was also coded on replit.com, but later uploaded to Github, therefore there are no other branches/long history of changes.
